    "q1": "Is WebP better than AVIF?",
    "a1": "Generally, AVIF offers better compression efficiency (smaller file sizes) than WebP for the same visual quality. However, WebP currently has slightly broader browser support.",
    "q2": "Can I open WebP on iPhone?",
    "a2": "Yes, modern iOS versions (iOS 14+) support WebP natively. If you have an older iPhone, converting to JPG is recommended.",
    "q3": "Is it safe to convert private photos here?",
    "a3": "Absolutely. Avifkit uses client-side processing technology. Your images are converted directly within your web browser memory and are never uploaded to any external server.",
    "q4": "Does this tool support transparency?",
    "a4": "Yes! If you convert AVIF to PNG or WebP, the transparent background (alpha channel) is preserved. If you convert to JPG, transparent areas will become white.",
    "q5": "How do I open AVIF on Windows 10?",
    "a5": "Windows 10 and 11 support AVIF if you install the 'AV1 Video Extension'. Alternatively, use Avifkit to convert them to standard JPGs."
