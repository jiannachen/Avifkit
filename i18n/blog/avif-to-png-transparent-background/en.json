          "question": "Will PNG files be larger than AVIF?",
          "answer": "Yes, typically 2-4x larger. PNG uses lossless compression, while AVIF uses aggressive lossy compression. The trade-off is compatibility - PNG works everywhere, AVIF doesn't."

          "answer": "Photoshop 2024 and newer have partial AVIF support, but it's buggy with certain color profiles and transparency modes. Converting to PNG first is more reliable."
