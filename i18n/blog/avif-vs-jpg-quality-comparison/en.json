          "question": "Is AVIF always smaller than JPG?",
          "answer": "At the same visual quality, yes - AVIF is typically 30-50% smaller. But if you crank up JPG compression, you can match file sizes. The quality just won't be as good."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why doesn't everyone use AVIF then?",
          "answer": "Compatibility. AVIF only works in modern browsers and apps. JPG works everywhere - old phones, email clients, legacy software, printing services. Universal support beats better compression for most use cases."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will converting AVIF to JPG make the file smaller?",
          "answer": "Usually, no. AVIF is already more compressed. Converting to JPG will likely result in a larger file, unless you apply heavy JPG compression (which degrades quality further)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I convert JPG to AVIF to save space?",
          "answer": "You can, but it won't help much. JPG is already lossy compressed. Converting lossy to lossy just adds more degradation. AVIF works best when you're compressing from a lossless source (PNG, TIFF, RAW)."
