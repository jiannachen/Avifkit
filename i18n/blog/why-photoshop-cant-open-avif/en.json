        {
          "question": "Will converting AVIF to PNG lose quality?",
          "answer": "AVIF is lossy compressed. PNG is lossless. So you're preserving whatever quality exists in the AVIF - you won't lose anything in the conversion. But you also can't magically recover quality that was already lost when the image was saved as AVIF."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why doesn't Adobe just fix this?",
          "answer": "AVIF is a complex format with many optional features. Full support requires implementing dozens of edge cases. Adobe's priority is features that affect paying customers - and right now, most professionals use JPG/PNG/TIFF, not AVIF."
