          "question": "Why can't Windows open AVIF files by default?",
          "answer": "AVIF is a relatively new image format (released in 2019). Windows 10 and 11 don't have native support built-in yet. Microsoft added partial support via an optional extension, but it's buggy and incomplete."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is AVIF better than JPG?",
          "answer": "Technically, yes. AVIF offers about 50% better compression at the same quality level. But compatibility is still terrible. If you need to share images or open them on multiple devices, JPG is safer."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will converting AVIF to JPG lose quality?",
          "answer": "Slightly, yes. But unless you're doing professional photo editing, you won't notice the difference. For everyday use (viewing photos, sharing on social media), JPG is perfectly fine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I convert AVIF to PNG instead?",
          "answer": "Yes, especially if your AVIF file has transparency. JPG doesn't support transparency, but PNG does. Use the {link:/avif-to-png|AVIF to PNG converter} if you need to preserve transparent backgrounds."
